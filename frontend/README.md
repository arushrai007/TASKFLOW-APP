🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.7+ & pip

    Node.js & yarn (or npm)

    MongoDB Atlas Account: A (free) MongoDB cloud database.

1. Configure Backend

    Navigate to the backend:
    Bash

cd TO-DO-APP-main/backend

Create a virtual environment:
Bash

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file: Create a file named .env inside the backend folder and add the following, replacing the placeholders with your own credentials:
Code snippet

    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@cluster0.xhqncic.mongodb.net/"

    # The name for your database (can be anything)
    DB_NAME="todo_database"

    # URL for your frontend
    CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"

    # A strong secret key for JWT
    JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-super-strong-secret-key-here"

    Whitelist your IP in MongoDB Atlas:

        Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

        Go to Security > Network Access.

        Click "Add IP Address" and select "Allow Access From My Current IP Address".

2. Configure Frontend

    Navigate to the frontend:
    Bash

cd TO-DO-APP-main/frontend

Install dependencies:
Bash

yarn install

Create .env file: Create a file named .env inside the frontend folder and add the following:
Code snippet

    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"

▶️ How to Run

You must run both the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

    Terminal 1: Run the Backend
    Bash

# Go to the backend directory
cd TO-DO-APP-main/backend

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # (or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

# Start the server
uvicorn server:app --reload

✅ Your backend is now running at http://localhost:8000

Terminal 2: Run the Frontend
Bash

    # Go to the frontend directory
    cd TO-DO-APP-main/frontend

    # Start the React app
    yarn start

    ✅ Your frontend is now running at http://localhost:3000

You can now access the application i

n your browser at http://localhost:3000.
